           Early Life & Education

Einstein was born in Ulm, W√ºrttemberg (Germany) on 14 March 1879.

His parents were Hermann Einstein (an engineer/salesman) and Pauline Koch.

The family moved to Munich about six weeks after his birth, where his father had business interests.

As a child Einstein showed deep curiosity: for example, he was fascinated by a compass at age five, wondering what invisible force made the needle move.

He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, but reportedly felt constrained by the rote-learning style of the school.

In 1894, his family moved to Italy (Milan) after business difficulties in Munich, and Einstein himself later left school in Munich to go to Switzerland.

He entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich (now ETH Zurich) in 1896 (after passing the entrance exam) to train as a teacher of mathematics and physics.

He graduated (or obtained his diploma) in 1900 and became a Swiss citizen in 1901.

Career and Major Contributions

After his diploma, he struggled to find a university position and in 1902 took a job as a technical assistant at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.

1905 proved to be his annus mirabilis (miracle year). In that year he published several groundbreaking papers: on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass‚Äìenergy equivalence (E = mc¬≤) among them.

The special theory of relativity (1905) and later the general theory of relativity (1915) fundamentally changed how we think about space, time and gravitation.

In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a professor at the University of Berlin.

In 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect and his contributions to theoretical physics.

Personal Life, Citizenship & Later Years

He was born German, renounced German citizenship (in 1896) and later became Swiss.

With the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany, Einstein (who was Jewish) left Germany in 1933 and moved to the United States where he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

He became a U.S. citizen in 1940.

Einstein was also politically and socially active: he spoke out on issues of war/peace, civil rights, Zionism, and the threat of nuclear weapons.

He continued working on physics, especially unified field theory (an attempt to unify gravitation and electromagnetism), though he did not succeed in the time he had.

Legacy & Death

Einstein died on 18 April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 
Wikipedia
+1

His legacy is enormous: his name and image are synonymous with ‚Äúgenius‚Äù. He reshaped physics and changed not just science but our worldview.

His equation E = mc¬≤ is perhaps the most widely recognized formula in the world. 
Wikipedia

Beyond scientific contributions, he is remembered for his philosophical reflections, humanism, and curiosity: ‚ÄúThe most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.‚Äù (a famous Einstein quote) 
NAS

Why He Matters

Change in Physics Paradigm: Before Einstein, physics was largely built on Newtonian mechanics. His theories introduced a new framework: relativity of time/space, equivalence of mass and energy, and so on.

Quantum Contributions: While he is commonly associated with relativity, Einstein‚Äôs work also laid important groundwork in quantum theory (e.g., his explanation of the photoelectric effect). 
Live Science

Inspiration & Culture: Einstein‚Äôs life story‚Äîmodest upbringing, solitary reflection, breakthrough thinking‚Äîbecame an inspiration beyond science. He has become a symbol of innovation and intellectual freedom.

Scientific Method & Philosophy: Einstein emphasised deep conceptual thinking, not just calculation. He believed science aims at uncovering underlying harmony and simplicity in nature.

            Final Summary of Albert Einstein

Born: 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Germany

Died: 18 April 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, USA

Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist whose ideas reshaped modern science. His most famous contributions include:

Theory of Special Relativity (1905) ‚Äì introducing the equation E = mc¬≤, showing mass and energy are interchangeable.

Theory of General Relativity (1915) ‚Äì describing gravity as the curvature of space and time.

Photoelectric Effect ‚Äì explaining how light can release electrons from metal, which earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.

üß† Legacy & Impact

Revolutionized physics and changed how we understand space, time, matter, and energy.

His name became synonymous with ‚Äúgenius.‚Äù

Advocated for peace, civil rights, and responsible use of science, especially after nuclear weapons were developed.

His ideas still influence modern technologies like GPS, lasers, and nuclear energy.

üåü In Simple Words

Einstein wasn‚Äôt just a scientist; he was a thinker who changed how humanity sees the universe. His curiosity, imagination, and courage to question the ordinary made him unforgettable.
